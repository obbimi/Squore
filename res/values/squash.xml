\n
\n- Dissent:
\nMinor offence (e.g. questioning a decision): Conduct Warning
\nMajor offence (e.g. prolonged or repeated questioning of or disagreement with decisions): Conduct Stroke

\nMajor offence (e.g. physical abuse of the opponent): Conduct Stroke
\nSevere offence (e.g. deliberately injuring the opponent; dangerous play that injures the opponent): Conduct Game or Match (depending on the severity of the offence and the extent of the injury caused)
\n
\n- Unsporting conduct:
\nMinor offence (e.g. making negative comments to the opponent): Conduct Warning
\nMajor offence (e.g. repeated negative or pejorative comments to the opponent; any attempt at intimidation of the opponent): Conduct Stroke

\n- Coaching:
\nFirst occurrence: Conduct Warning
\nSecond occurrence: Conduct Stroke and expulsion of offending person
\n
\n- Repeated and excessive bad conduct:
\nWhen, in the Referee’s opinion, the player is guilty of repeated acts of unacceptable conduct on court following the imposition of the penalties outlined above, the Referee may impose for the next occurrence of the offence either the same penalty for the second offence or a more severe penalty than the one already imposed. However, if a Conduct Warning has been given for both the first and the second offences, for the third offence of a similar nature a Conduct Stroke must be applied. (Example: If a player has received a Conduct Warning for Dissent, on the next occurrence of this offence, either a Conduct Warning or a Conduct Stroke may be imposed. On the third occurrence, however, a Conduct Stroke is mandatory.)
