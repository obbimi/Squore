I have made a spin-of of my fairly widely use squash app 'Squore' to an app for Racketlon. 
I don't know if there is any real need for it, but at least now you know that it exists.

Ik heb een spin-of van Squore (Scorebord voor Squash) voor Racketlon gemaakt. 
Ik weet niet of er echt behoefte aan is... maar ik kon in de Google Play Store nog helemaal niets voor Racketlon vinden. 
Nu is er in elk geval al wel eentje.

Suggesties zijn welkom.
