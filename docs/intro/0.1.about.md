## Introduction

The Android App 'Squore - Squash Ref Tool' assist you in keeping the score while you are referee-ing a squash match.
The name is simply the first 3 letters of 'squash' followed by the last three letters of 'score': Squ-ore.

* Keeping score
* Keeping track of what side a player must serve

During squash tournaments it can support the organisers by:
* [Live Score](/tournament/livescore): have updated results available on a webpage
* [ChromeCast](chromecast.md) the score on to a TV
* Select matches from web [feeds](match.from.feed.md) (e.g. feeds containing matches from a tournament on [Tournamentsoftware](http://tournamentsoftware.com) )

Besides that it has several functions that might be to your liking. For example
* Use [timers](timers.md)
* Present dialogs with [official announcements](3.7.announcements.md) to be made
* Record [calls](3.5.appeals.conducts.md) (No Let, Let, Stroke, Conduct Warning, Conduct Stroke)
* [Customize colors](colors.md) e.g. to match your club colors
* Show scoring history in a [graph](graphs.md)
* Sharing the result (Link with entire score sheet, Message with summary, Email, or post to a website)
* Stores the entire scoring history for later referencing
* Select matches from custom web feeds (e.g. containing matches to be played at your club)
    * Within custom feeds avatars can be specified per player to display in the app
* Post match result to your [clubs website](4.7.club.website.md)
* Show a web page with the official WSF squash rules

Other 'less commonly used' features are:
* Transfer in-progress match to another device
