### Appearance

#### Action bar

If you have a relatively small screen you might want to use the option to hide the 'Action Bar'.
In this way more room will be come available for the other buttons of the score board.

Most options the app that you need during a match
* become available at the appropriate time by means of floating buttons
* are available by (long) tapping or swiping the appropriate screen element(s).

But if you quickly want the action bar back into view: long click the game-scores.
(By the way: The same action can be used to hide the action-bar).

### Players

This option contains a list of names that is used for 'Auto Completion' player names while you are typing.
If you have e.g. a text file with all the names of your fellow club mates, you can past it here.
Each line should contain just one name.

Each player name you use for a match is automatically added to this list.
So if you enter `Patrick` as one of the players of a match, the next time you are defining a match and start typing e.g. `Pa`,
the value `Patrick` will be suggested for auto-completion.

### List of matches

This option contains the textual format of matches stored for 'Select match from fixed list'.

Lines starting with a dash represent 'Headers'.
A typical example would be:

    - World Championships 2014 > Semi Finals
    Gregory Gaultier - Ramy Ashour
    Nick Matthew - Mohamed Elshorbagy

    - Tuesday matches with me mates
    James - Richard
    Richard - Steven
    Steven - James

Also note that the name of the Header will be used as 'Event Name' and 'Event Round' if it can be split nicely into two at `>`, `:` or `-` characters contained in the header.

For example: If the app user were to select the Match `Gregory Gaultier - Ramy Ashour` from the section/header `World Championships 2014 > Semi Finals` that
the 'Event' of the match would become _World Championships 2014_ and the 'Round' would become _Semi Finals_
