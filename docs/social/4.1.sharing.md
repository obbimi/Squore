## Sharing

When the match has come to an end, a floating 'Share' button will appear:

![Main with floating share"](../img/sb.main.06.floating.sharebutton.png)

If a user clicks on the share link, this user can consult the entire scoring history.
An example of what a user can see looks like this:

![Share scoring history"](../img/browser.shared.score.history.01.png)

If they open the shared link on the device with Squore installed, they user has the option to open the URL with Squore (in stead of with a browser).
If he/she chooses to do so, the match details will be downloaded and can be viewed with the Squore app.

### Share on Facebook

If decide to use facebook for sharing the link, it will typically look like this.

![Facebook share squore"](../img/facebook.share.01.png)

### Share URL by email

In stead of sharing the link on e.g. facebook, you can also _share_ it by mailing the link to e.g.
* the players involved in the match
* the tournament organization the match is played in

### Share multiple matches at once

If for example your club has played against another club and all matches were reffed with Squore, preferrable with the same device, you can share a summary of all matches in one single mail or whatsapp message.
You can do this by selecting `Stored Matches` from the menu, go to the tab `Recent matches` were you are presented with recent matches and checkboxes behind each match.

![Share multiple"](../img/share.multiple.01.png)

Check the 'related' matches and press the `Share button`.
A message similar to this one will be composed for sharing e.g. by email or whatsapp.

    Raneem El Welily - Joelle King : 3 - 1

    11-6
    5-11
    11-7
    11-7
