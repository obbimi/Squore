## Feed/Post URLs

If you play in a club where matches are scheduled and this schedule is published online e.g. on your clubs website,
you can ask you webmaster to provide URLs
* that return all matches to be played in plain text or json format ('FeedMatches'), and/or
* that return all the names of the players that participate in matches in plain text ('FeedPlayers') and/or
* that allow match results to be posted to, so they are immediately stored on the website.

Providing just an URL with only the player names can already be useful to make entering the playernames into Squore more easy.
A typical example would be: <http://squore.double-yellow.be/demo/demo.players.txt>

Providing an URL with matches, makes starting reffing a match even more easy, by simply selecting the match from a list.
A typical example would be: <http://boxen.double-yellow.be/matches.json.php>

Providing an URL to allow posting the result back to your site would safe you from the burden of entering results manually.

### Configuring the URLs

By default a few Feed/Post urls are configured.
If you really want this option to be useful, you should of course add your own URLs.

Based on the examples in the app you and/or your web-master should be able to deduce the settings required for your new feed.

A typically example of having to different feeds is:

    Name=Demo URL
    FeedMatches=http://squore.double-yellow.be/demo/demo.matches.json
    FeedPlayers=http://squore.double-yellow.be/demo/demo.players.txt
    PostResult=http://squore.double-yellow.be/demo/demo.post.matchresult.php

    Name=DYBoxen
    FeedMatches=http://www.double-yellow.be/box/matches.json.php

Manually entering this while 'developing' the URLs for your club/organization will be required.
If your URL(s) are working as desired, the best option is to let the Squore developers know your URLs and we can add them
to the list of available 'Feeds' so your club members can easily 'activate' the URL's in Squore running on their personal device.  

Only one of the specified feed/post URLs can be active.
You can select the one you want to be active under 'Settings/Internet/Active URLs'.

But it is more easy to switch URLs via the 'Switch feed...' action bar button (globe icon)/menu option that is available 
when you look at the 'Feed' tab of the 'Select match' dialog/activity.

For more details about these URLs, see the sections below.

If the 'Active feed/post' URL does indeed contain a 'Post' url and you select the option 'Settings/Internet/Suggest to post'
than, when a match is finished the app will automatically suggest to post the result to the configured Post URL.

### Authentication

If you want to protect you url where results can be posted to, there is the option to protect it with basic authentication.
To do so add a line with `Authentication=Basic` to your URLs configuration. So for example it will look like this now:

    Name=Demo URL
    FeedMatches=https://squore.double-yellow.be/demo/demo.matches.json
    FeedPlayers=https://squore.double-yellow.be/demo/demo.players.txt
    PostResult=https://squore.double-yellow.be/demo/demo.post.matchresult.basic.auth.php
    Authentication=Basic

If this line exists in your 'Active' URL section, the Squore app will ask a Username and Password combination before posting the result to the URL.

An example of enforcing basic authentication with php pages is for example as follows:

    <?php
        if ( ! isset($_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER'] ) ) {
            header('WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Double-Yellow Boxen"');
            header('HTTP/1.0 401 Unauthorized');
            echo 'Text to send if user does not provide credentials';
            exit;
        } else {
            echo "<p>Hello {$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_USER']}.</p>";
            echo "<p>You entered {$_SERVER['PHP_AUTH_PW']} as your password.</p>";
        }
    ?>

### Pass on the URLs

Once you have configured URLs that are relevant e.g. for your club, you of course want to ensure your fellow club members
also use these URLs within their Squore app. The easiest way is to pass the settings from one phone to another by NFC/S-Bean/Android Beam:

Ensure NFC/S-Bean/Android Beam is turned on for both phones.

Simply
* On device A: go to 'Start new match',
* go to the tab that shows all matches in your feed
* hold both devices back-to-back
* If all goes well, NFC/Android-Beam will automatically kick in on the device A having the 'Feed' open.
* Simply click on the screen of device A to confirm that you want to transmit data
* The Feed settings should now be transferred to the Squore app installed on device B (The Squore app should automatically start on device B)
* Verify this by selecting 'Start new match' and going to the 'Feed' tab. It should show the data from the same feed.

Another option would be
* copying the text from _Settings/Internet/Selectable Feed URLs_,
* mail it to your fellow club members instructing them to
    * paste this text in their _Selectable Feed URLs_ settings
    * from the _Active URLs_ settings select the appropriate feed
* let me, the developer of this app, know your settings and I will it included it in the 'Selectable Feeds'

### Feed Matches

The 'FeedMatches' URL should contain either
- lines describing the matches to be played, one-match-per-line, or
- matches to be played in JSON format (more complex but far more flexible)

#### one-match-per-line

If you choose the one-match-line-per-line option, you optionally can include sections by prefixing a line with a dash.

A simple example would be:

    [Double Yellow Boxen - Session 3]
    - week 4
    09:30-1 Wim M - Bruno D
    09:30-2 Dieter O - Olivier B
    10:15-1 Kaj D - Koen D
    10:15-2 Kjell H - Thomas G
    11:00-1 Wendi W - Melanie G
    11:00-2 Caron V - Pascale A
    11:45-1 Georges D - Kurt V
    11:45-2 Olivier B - Erwin D
    12:30-1 Iddo H - Guy G
    12:30-2 Guy D - Myriam S
    - week 5
    09:30-1 Jolan B - Thomas G
    09:30-2 Luka D - Koen D
    10:15-1 Rene V - Olivier B
    10:15-2 Sergio A - Fran D
    11:00-1 Eric V - Wendi W
    11:00-2 Wim M - Kilian S
    11:45-1 Eric V - Melanie G
    11:45-2 Guy D - Casper D

Also note that the name of the feed will be used as 'Event Name' and the 'section' name will be used as the 'Round' of a match.

For example: If the app user were to select the Match `Olivier B - Erwin D` from the section `week 4` that
the 'Event' of the match would become the name of the Feed (e.g. `Double Yellow Boxen`) and the 'Round' would become `week 4`

If the very first line of the feed contains some text between square brackets (e.g `[Double Yellow Boxen - Session 3]`), this
automatically will become the name of the feed within the Squore app. This allows for users to keep a fixed feed URL
while the name of the feed (and thus the default event name) may change from time to time.

#### JSON

If you choose the JSON option, a simplest example would look something like this:

    { "config" : { "name" : "Squore Demo Feed" }
    , "+Session 4, Week 2":[
      { "A": "Sergio A", "B": "Hannelore D" },
      { "A": "Koen M"  , "B": "Yannick D"   },
      { "A": "Kevin V" , "B": "Georges D"   }
    ]
    , "Session 4, Week 3":[
      { "A": "Sergio A", "B": "Yannick D" },
      { "A": "Bert S"  , "B": "Gertjan V" }
    ]
    }

A more complex example can be found [here](https://squore.double-yellow.be/demo/demo.matches.json).

As you can see, per match a lot more options that just specifying the names are available. (id/date/time/field/round of a match. avatar/country of a player)
The `id` of match can be specifically useful if you want the result of a match be posted back to your website.

If you prefix a 'section' of matches with a '+' it will be interpreted by the app to show this section as 'expanded' by default.


### Feed Players

The 'FeedPlayers' URL feed should simple list all players. (one-player-per-line)
This feed is mainly used to simplify entering player names for new matches.
As soon as you have typed a few characters of a name, all matching names are presented for you to select from.

A typical example of what the 'FeedPlayers' URL returns would be:

    Gregory Gaultier
    Nick Matthew
    Mohamed Elshorbagy
    Ramy Ashour
    Borja Golan
    James Willstrop
    Peter Barker
    Amr Shabana
    Karim Darwish
    Daryl Selby

    Nicol David
    Laura Massaro
    Raneem El Welily
    Joelle King
    Alison Waters
    Camille Serme
    Low Wee Wern
    Madeline Perry
    Annie Au
    Jenny Duncalf
