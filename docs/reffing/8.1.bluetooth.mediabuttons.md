## Remote controlling the score

Because of the fact that if you have the app open on both your wearable and your phone, the scores will stay in sync, you more or less have a 'remote control' for changing the score on your phone or tablet.
But if you don't own a wearable, there are other options:

- Using bluetooth keyboard (or a device that mimics some keyboard strokes like a 'pen' to switch powerpoint slides)
- Using bluetooth media control buttons (simple)
- Using FCM (Firebase Cloud Messaging)

The last one is very flexible but harder to setup.
Contact the developer if you want more info about FCM.

### Keyboard

If you pair the keyboard with your device and the app is running you can change 
- the score for player A by pressing
  - A
  - PgUp
- the score for player B by pressing
  - B
  - PgDn
- correct the score by pressing 
  - U (Undo), or
  - R (Revert)


### Media control buttons

Controlling the score via a small device like this

![Bluetooth Media Buttons](../img/bluetooth.media.buttons.01.jpg)

is simple.

* Pair your phone/table with such a bluetooth device.
* Turn the option on in the app: *Settings > Behaviour > Scoring by Media Playback Buttons*

Now, when the app is in the foreground, you can control the score with the 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons.
And you can 'Undo' the score by pressing the 'Play/Pause' button.

I've heard of people either:

* wearing the button like a watch
* attaching the buttons somewhere on the side of the court/playing area
* attaching the buttons to their clothes
