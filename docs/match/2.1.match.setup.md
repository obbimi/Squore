## Setting up a match

You can start a new match most easily by clicking on the '+' floating button in the lower right of the screen.

![Plus button"](../img/sb.main.plusbutton.png)

This button appears if the current match has finished (or is locked because it has not been changed in quite a while).

If this 'floating' button does not appear for some reason, you can also start a new match
by clicking on the appropriate item from the left 'Navigation bar'.
Or select 'New/Match...' from the menu.

This will result in a dialog with a few 'tabs'.
* One allows you define a [singles](2.5.match.singles.md) match manually
* A similar tab allows you to start a [doubles](2.6.match.doubles.md) match
* One shows you a [personal list](match.from.mylist.md) of matches that you can completely maintain manually.
* One shows you matches from an URL [Feed](match.from.feed.md).

For the first two options you will have to enter all player names manually.

Note: if you enter all player names entirely in lower case, the app will assume you were to lazy to use capitals and will capitalize all first letters for you.

![Matches Event and Format"](../img/sb.matches.03.format.png)

Often this is sufficient.
But if you ref a lot of matches, e.g. in the course of a tournament, it is more easy to select the match to ref from a list.

The last two options serve this purpose:

* [Personal list](match.from.mylist.md) 
* [Feeds](match.from.feed.md)
